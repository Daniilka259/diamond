WELCOME TO DIAMOND LANGUAGE

Output text to console:

	write("Hello world");

At the end of each command, put ;
	
Create a function:

	To create a function, you must enter void and the name of the function.
	Example: void main(){}
	Curly braces are needed for the interpreter to read
	where is the beginning of the function and where is the end.

Function call:

	To call the function, we need to put $ and after in the name of the function
	Example: $main()

Create a variable:

	There are three ways to create variables, but it is better to use only
	two ways and use the third to change the variable
	Example:

	one way:  var a;
			  a = var(1);
    In one way, we created a variable called "a" and changed its value to 1
    two way:  a := 1;
    		  a = 2;
    in the second way, we created a variable "a" with a value of 1 and changed it to 2
    RULE: You cannot change variables using the ":=" sign
    Also for digital variables there are change signs such as "+=" and "-="

Conditions:

	There are if,else and elif command to create conditions
	Example:
	i := 1
	if(i == 3){
		write('Variable i = 3');
	}
	elif(i == 2){
		write('Variable i = 2');
	}
	else {
		write('All conditions are not correct')
	}

Cycles:

	There are 2 ways to create loop: for and while
	If you are familiar with other programming languages, you know how to work with them.
	Example:
	The first script will output Hello 3 times

	for(i=1;i<4;i++){
		write('Hello');
	}

	the second will output Hello while run = true
	
	run = true;
	while(run){
		write('Hello');
	}
